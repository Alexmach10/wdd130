    <h2>Alexis Machuca</h2>
    <p>My name is Alexis Machuca, I was born in Honduras but I currently live in Guatemala with my family. I was blessed to serve as a missionary in this beautiful country and I fell in love with its culture and customs.</p>
    <p>I am the father of two wonderful children and I am happy to be able to study something that I am passionate about. I always wanted to expand my knowledge and be an expert in what I like.</p>
